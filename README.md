# chat
a multithreaded chat server and client in C++


Built for an Operating Systems class at university in order to demonstrate knowledge of concepts like threading, locks and mutexes, sockets...
Started in C with pthreads but then I began using C++ threads because they're easier and I really didn't feel the need to build data structures from scratch ; )
